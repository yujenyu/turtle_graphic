## Add scope manipulation in parser (sym_scope)

Since the '}' is produced by <INSTRCTLST>, I decrease the scope when the do-loop
ends, after '}' is read (note that '}' is read multiple times since it is part
of the <INSTRCTLST>).

## LOGO Test Programs (under "/prog" folder)

Most test program is rewrite from LOGO language and reference to "Logo 15-word
challenge" website. (http://www.mathcats.com/gallery/15wordcontest.html)
Others are rewritten from internet resources or directly from problem examples.
For "dahlia.lgo", changing J's repetition from 1 to 7 can show different result.

## Show input program filename on window

Use <SDL_SetWindowTitle> function, Extract the filename from a compelete path by
<basename> function which included in <libgen.h>

## Random color

Use random number to render the graph and background in <SDL_SetRenderDrawColor>
function. I adjust the parameters by random numbers to make the output window's
color change randomly.
